# TSOClient — Claude context

## What this project is

A native macOS wrapper around The Settlers Online (TSO), built as an automation and enhancement platform. The game runs inside a `WKWebView`. The current TSO client is a **Unity WebGL** build (the original Flash client was retired with Flash itself; a brief HTML5 era preceded Unity). The backend protocol is unchanged — GameServer responses are still AMF3/Flex over `fetch`, which is why the AMF3 scanner keeps working. Behaviour is extended through injected JavaScript that intercepts network responses and substitutes textures to highlight collectibles. Swift owns the native chrome, data models, and image processing; JavaScript owns in-page interception and texture patching.

**Unity-client implications** (do not relearn each session):
- The game canvas is a single WebGL2 context; there is no JS-accessible game state (`window.s_oIsland` / `s_oMain` / `s_oGame` etc. **do not exist**). Camera position lives inside the wasm heap.
- Building textures **are** fetched individually via `fetch()` from Ubisoft's CDN (`ubistatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontend/GFX_HASHED/building_lib/<sha1>.png`). This is how the collectible texture patcher works: it intercepts those fetches and returns a synthetic pink PNG for known collectible hashes. `<img>` elements are not used for game art.
- `gameevents.registerHook` exposes only coarse lifecycle triggers (`triggerLevelUp`, `triggerTutorialEnd`, `triggerFriendInvite`, `triggerClientLoaded`); not useful for game-state reading.

The long-term goal is a full automation suite: collectible highlighting, explorer/specialist dispatch, buffing, adventure management. The **Collectible Highlighter** shipped (via texture substitution). **Specialist Dispatch** is server-side end-to-end verified — the AMF3 RPC reaches GameServer, the server accepts, and specialists actually start the task. The remaining gap is that Unity's in-game UI (greyed icon + countdown bar in the star menu) only reflects the change after a zone reload; our injected `fetch` bypasses Unity's local state. See `specialist-dispatch.md` for AMF wire-format details and `log.md` for the current in-game-UI-refresh investigation.

**What a collectible is:** a resource item (herbs, banner, food cart, etc.) that spawns at a random map tile on the player's island and is picked up by clicking. *Not* a building, and *not* the per-building "ready to collect" stockpile (`dPersistedPickupItemVO`). The feature mirrors what the **Pinky** Chrome extension and the Windows AIR client (`fedorovvl/tso_client`) do for the same game.

## Architecture in one paragraph

`WebView` loads `thesettlersonline.com`. `JSInjection` installs four JS modules at `atDocumentStart` in dependency order: **bridge.js** (sets up `window.TSOBridge` for Swift→JS and `window._tsoSend` for JS→Swift), **amf3-scanner.js** (wraps `window.fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest`, deserialises GameServer AMF3 binary responses, emits `COLLECTIBLES` and `SPECIALISTS` messages, caches auth context in `window._tsoAuthCtx`), **amf3-encoder.js** (AMF3 serialiser, builds `RemotingMessage` envelopes, exposes `_TSORPC.dispatchSpecialist` and registers the `DISPATCH_SPECIALIST` TSOBridge handler), **collectible-patcher.js** (wraps `fetch` + `XHR`; for 55 known collectible building-texture hashes returns a 32×32 hot-pink synthetic PNG so Unity renders those buildings pink in-world). JS→Swift uses two named `WKScriptMessageHandler` channels: `"logger"` (raw strings) and `"tso"` (structured `{type, payload}` JSON). Swift→JS goes through `BridgeSender.send(_ msg: OutboundMessage)`, which calls `webView.evaluateJavaScript(msg.jsExpression)`. `BridgeRouter` maps decoded `InboundMessage` values to store mutations on the main thread.

## Bridge protocol

**JS → Swift (`"tso"` handler):**
- `COLLECTIBLES` — `{mapWidth, mapHeight, items:[{gridIndex,x,y,assetName}]}`
- `GAME_STATE`   — `{state:"LOADED"|"ZONE_CHANGED"|"ZONE_LEFT", zoneId?}`
- `SPECIALISTS`  — `{items:[{uid,uid1,uid2,specialistType,name,isIdle,taskEndTime?}]}`

**Swift → JS (`BridgeSender.send(_:)` → `OutboundMessage.jsExpression`):**
- `DISPATCH_SPECIALIST` — `{uid1, uid2, actionType, taskCode, targetGrid}` → handled by `amf3-encoder.js`

## Highlighting approach

Collectibles are highlighted by **texture substitution**: `collectible-patcher.js` intercepts `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` calls for collectible building PNG textures (matched by SHA-1 hash against a 55-entry list in `collectible-hashes.json`) and returns a synthetic 32×32 hot-pink image instead. Unity uploads the substituted bytes as a GL texture and renders the collectible pink in-world. No overlay canvas, no calibration, no camera tracking is needed.

The canvas overlay approach was abandoned in Iteration 7 because Unity renders via its wasm heap — no JS-accessible camera globals exist.

## Key invariants

- `WebView.updateNSView` guards `webView.url == nil` — do not remove this or the game reloads on every SwiftUI state change.
- JS injection order: **bridge → scanner → encoder → patcher**. The patcher must run **after** the scanner because it wraps the scanner's already-patched `window.fetch`; reversing the order breaks AMF3 parsing on non-collectible URLs.
- AMF3 VO object-literal member order in `amf3-encoder.js` is load-bearing (trait registration is order-dependent on the wire).
- `WKUserContentController.add(_:name:)` retains the handler — `WebViewCoordinator` is `NSObject`, no extra wrapper needed.
- `@Observable` (Swift 5.9 macro, not `ObservableObject`). Use `@State` at the owner site; the class reference propagates automatically.

## Xcode practices (token efficiency)

- **Synchronized folder group**: adding, renaming, or moving `.swift`, `.js`, `.json` files inside `TSOClient/TSOClient/` requires **no pbxproj edits**. The Xcode project uses `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`.
- **Build via CLI** to get structured errors without opening Xcode:
  ```
  DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcodebuild -project TSOClient/TSOClient.xcodeproj \
             -scheme TSOClient \
             -destination 'platform=macOS' \
             build 2>&1 | grep -E "error:|warning:" | head -40
  ```
- **Swift syntax check** a single file without building:
  ```
  swiftc -typecheck -sdk $(xcrun --show-sdk-path) \
         -target arm64-apple-macos14.0 \
         TSOClient/TSOClient/<file>.swift
  ```
- **Entitlements / plist issues** surface at signing time, not compile time — check `TSOClient.entitlements` and `Info.plist` directly if the app crashes at launch.
- **JS debugging**: add `webkit.messageHandlers.logger.postMessage(...)` calls freely; they stream to Xcode console with `[JS]` prefix. Never remove the `"logger"` handler registration.
- **JS files**: edit `Resources/JS/*.js` directly. No recompile needed to change JS logic — only a re-run.

## What does NOT exist yet

- **In-game UI refresh on injected dispatch** — Unity's specialist icon doesn't grey out / show its countdown bar until a zone reload, because our `fetch` bypasses Unity's local state. Investigation plan in `log.md`.
- Task countdown timer in our own panel — `collectedTime` is a game-internal clock; conversion to real time is unknown.
- General dispatch auto-populated with `garrisonBuildingGridPos` (user must enter grid manually for now).
- Buff management, adventure features, trading, building automation.
- Persistent storage of dispatch templates or any app settings.
- Unit or UI tests.
